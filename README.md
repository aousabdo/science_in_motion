# Science in Motion

A collection of physics simulations and visualizations optimized for TikTok. This repository contains Python scripts that generate mesmerizing animations of various physical phenomena.

## Current Visualizations

### Double Pendulum
The double pendulum script (`double_pendulum_tiktok.py`) simulates the chaotic motion of a double pendulum system. It creates a visually striking animation with the following features:
- Portrait mode (9:16 aspect ratio) optimized for TikTok
- Dark background with high-contrast elements
- Trace of the pendulum's path
- Full 30 seconds of mesmerizing chaotic motion

### Lorenz Attractor
The Lorenz attractor script (`lorenz-attractor.py`) visualizes the famous Lorenz system, a set of differential equations known for exhibiting chaotic behavior. Features include:
- 3D visualization with animated camera perspective
- Color gradients that change over time
- Mathematical equations displayed
- TikTok-optimized portrait format

## Requirements

All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Simply run either Python script to generate the corresponding visualization:

```bash
python double_pendulum_tiktok.py
# or
python lorenz-attractor.py
```

Each script will create an MP4 file in the current directory.
